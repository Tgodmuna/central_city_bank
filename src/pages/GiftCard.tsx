            Central National Bank Visa Gift Cards are available at any Central National Bank location in any amount between $10-$1000 and can be used everywhere Visa debit cards are accepted.
            <br /><br />
            The Central National Bank Visa Gift Card cannot be reloaded with additional funds, nor can it be used at an ATM (Automated Teller Machine). Subject to applicable law, if there has been no activity on your card for 12 consecutive months, beginning the 13th month, a monthly inactivity fee of $4.95 will be assessed.

                  First, sign the signature panel and the back of the Card. We also suggest that you write down the gift card number and the customer service number from the back of the Card on a separate piece of paper in case the gift card is lost or stolen. You can then use your card everywhere Visa debit cards are accepted provided there are sufficient funds loaded on the Card to cover the full amount of your purchase. Present it to the clerk when making a purchase, and sign the form or receipt. If the merchant requests, instruct the merchant to select "Credit" on the terminal.

                  You may use your gift card at a restaurant the same as you do at any other merchant. However, it is common for service-oriented merchants to automatically factor in an additional 20% to cover any tip you may leave on the card. If your total bill, after adding in the additional 20%, exceeds the amount on the gift card, it will be declined. You should ensure that your gift card has an available balance that is 20% greater than your total bill. To avoid a decline of, or a hold on, your gift card, you can ask the merchant to authorize a specific dollar amount. We do not guarantee that the merchant will fulfill this request.
